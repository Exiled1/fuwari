## Start of a Journey!

So, I'm getting antsy in Software Engineering, and ever since competing in DEFCON finals with my team OSUSEC, I've thought that the journey would just be much easier. I was wrong lol. I've grown complacent as all heck resolving Jira tickets every day and doing standup, the past year basically flew by and I'm not doing what I love and hacking stuff yet; as a result, I'm going to train myself in the "next steps" after doing CTFs for 5+ years now (yikes).

To do that, I'm gonna do a couple things, first *credit card swipe*, that's right baby, we're purchasing our OSCP! I'll probably make a post about it later or at least make posts about what it's like to study for the OSCP while working a SWE job and also attempting to make a videogame company in China (rip my wallet).

Next, I'm gonna see if I can prove all the people on Reddit wrong that say "cyBeRseCuRitY iSn'T EnTry leVel" because it's honestly getting old hearing that you **NEED** to make a barely livable 45k salary for 4 years in helpdesk or other jobs just to get a *chance* at security.

Oh, also I'm gonna be seeing if I can get my Security+ cert in 2 weeks (once I actually start the prep for it). 

Anyways, outside of certs, what do we need to get started?

## Goals

I have a roadmap for myself!

Everything I want to learn:

- Malware analysis
    - Learn shit from:
        - kc7 cyber ([Link](https://kc7cyber.com/modules))
        - https://letsdefend.io/
        - Thedfirreport runs occasional ctfs but they cost money to do
        - https://chuongdong.com/
    - Learn Analysis by doing malware development.
- Detection engineering (Goes hand in hand w/ malware analysis)
    - 100 days of YARA
- Penetration testing with web/In general
    - Metasploit
    - HackTheBox
- SOC/Blue skills
    - Splunk/SIEM
- Security Engineering
  - Splunk/SIEM
  - 

Stuff Iâ€™m working on:
- [ ]  OSCP

## Trimming the impossible

To start off, I'm gonna go ahead and say that SOC jobs are just out of the question, not because they're hard, but because people genuinely only care that you've done SOC work before and even a T1 analyst needs that age old help desk/IT background (Also it's boring).
